The objective of this project is to develop an RTOS from scratch for learning purposes.
At the same time, I'll practice non-platform/non-OS specific architecture.
At the moment, we are developing for platform STM32F446RE.

In order to run locally you will need:
- ARM GNU Toolchain, specifically "Arch32 bare-metal target" (version 11 >=)
- Python 3 (any version)
- Git (obviously)
- STM32F446RE-NUCLEO board
